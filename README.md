# yetAnotherMovieDB, C# 2019 Project for Code Louisville

Solving a family problem of accidentally buying multiple movies from the $5 bins and forgetting we already own it. This is a console app using a sqlite database allowing me to add, delete, edit, search, and view movies I own. I intend on continuing to improve this project and also create a front end for it. For example, my next step is to fix validation issues and add more validation to prevent duplicates. I'd like to alter the table to have a unique id column.

It would solve problems for us to create a list of things we have, keep track of duplicates and when we remove duplicates. It wouldn't be limited only to movies. It could be for any collection. The plan is to make it more for mobile (iOS and Android) but I'd keep a desktop version too. I'd like to be able to access while I'm out getting ready to buy; I never intend on buying a movie and checking before I leave the house. :)
